# Functional Programming in TypeScript Workshop

[![CI Build](https://github.com/kutyel/fp-typescript-workshop/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kutyel/fp-typescript-workshop/actions/workflows/main.yml)

⚡️ Let's learn some functional programming together!

We will be using the amazing [Effect.ts](https://effect.website/) library because it is designed from the ground up to work nicely with TypeScript! 😎

## Requirements

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)!

> This project uses Bun instead of Node as an experiment and to make things crazy fast! 🚄

If you are using homebrew:

```sh
$ brew tap oven-sh/bun # for macOS and Linux
$ brew install bun
```

## Run the tests and solve the exercises!

```sh
$ npm run test:watch
```

Happy coding! ⚡️
